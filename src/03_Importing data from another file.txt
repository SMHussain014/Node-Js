We can import data from one file to another file in Node Js.
Step 1:
Make two files with names index.js and app.js.
To export a file, write the following code in app.js file:
module.exports = {
x: 10,
y: 20,
z: function(){
    return 10;
}
}
To import a file, write the following code in index.js file:
const app = require(`./app`);
console.log(app);
console.log(app.x);
console.log(app.y);
console.log(app.z());
